Course "The Geometry of Data" for the AIMS Rwanda Training School, Spring 2023. See the course webpage at

Some of the jupyter notebooks in this GitHub repository are from the "Python Data Science Handbook":

These notebooks include:

and

# Installation instructions

We will be running a few jupyter notebooks. I recommend doing so locally on your computer. To do so, I first recommend installing Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Afterwards, install scikit-learn on your computer, using a terminal command such as "pip install -U scikit-learn". Then, download the course jupyter notebooks (the .ipynb files) from this Course GitHub Page. In your terminal, go to the folder containing these download files, and type "jupyter notebook" in the terminal. This should open a browser, where you can select one of the jupyter notebooks to run, which should open in your browser in a graphical user interface.

If the above installation instructions don't yet work for you, please solicit help from somebody with more experience with jupyter notebooks. As a possible back-up plan, you can try skipping the local installation and instead try running things directly in your browser using Colab; see for example the K-means Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.11-K-Means.ipynb) or the PCA Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/05.09-Principal-Component-Analysis.ipynb). However, jupyter notebooks tend to work better when downloaded locally, and so alternatively you can work with somebody for whom the installation was successful.
